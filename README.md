## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a Junior Frontend Developer with a **Bachelor’s degree in Digital Technologies and Coding** and hands-on experience in **Angular**, **usability**, **web accessibility**, and **end-to-end testing**.  
During my time at **Covestro**, I contributed to real-world projects, developing frontend components and helping build AI-driven applications.

I work in a structured and focused way, learn quickly, and enjoy creating intuitive, clean, and user-friendly interfaces.  
I am currently looking for a **Junior Frontend Developer** position where I can continue growing my skills and contribute to meaningful digital products.
